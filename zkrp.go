//  * Set Membership Proofs based on the paper: Efficient protocols for set membership and range proofs, by Jan Camenisch, Rafik Chaabouni and Abhi Shelat.
//  * Bulletproofs based on paper: Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More, by Benedikt BÃ¼nz, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew Poelstra, Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell.
